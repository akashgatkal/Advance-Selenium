-->Data drivern Testing: it is a process of driving the data from the external file
                                            such as excel,properties,json,Database etc and use it inside the script.
-->Advantage-
1)Data Manipulation
2)Avoid hardWorking
3)Data Management
4)Actions Optimizations



To become Good aumomation Tester we have to follow
1)code Optimizations
2)code Readability
3)Avoid Hardcoding
4)Dynamic way


Assertion:
-->It is Library or Function which is used to verify or VAlidate the expected result with actual result.
--> Types
1)Hard Assert
2) Soft Assert

1)Hard Assert:
--> It is the one of the Assert type which is having some  predefined methods like
                                    assertEquals();
                                    assertNotEquals();
                                    assertTrue();
                                    assertFalse();
                                    assertNull();
                                    assertNotNull();
-->If the Comparison is failed at that time it will terminate the process.
2)Soft Assert:
--> It is the one of the Assert type which is having some  predefined Non-Static methods like
                                    assertEquals();
                                    assertNotEquals();
                                    assertTrue();
                                    assertFalse();
                                    assertNull();
                                    assertNotNull();
                                    assertAll();-To get the all of the fails test.....is a methods which records all failures.
-->These are the Non-Static methods to  use this we have to create Object Of Soft Assert.
                SoftAssert ref=new SoftAssert();
-->If the Comparison is failed at that time it will Not terminate the process.
